# Assignment-2

Elizabeth Egerman

Description
For this assignment we are using Neville's method to find the 2nd degree interpolating value, we are using newton's forward method to find the polynomial approximations for degrees 1,2, and 3 and then approximating a value based off of that. We also are using the divided differences method to find the Hermite polynomial matrix, and using cubic spline interpolation to solve for different values. This assignemnt takes in a lot of data tables and creating formulas and functions to print out the needed information. This helps us to approximate points on curves.

Installation
init.py to import any packages. For this assignment, only numpy was required. To get this, you will type "import numpy as np".
There is no need for the requirements.txt since we only need numpy, however I included it as well as a precaution. This would be necessary if you needed to install packages other than numpy.

Running the program
In the command line you will hit the triangle button the run the program. I had to use the debug python file because my __init__ wasn't working properly.
